Hello, I am a current graduate student at the [Language Technologies Institute (LTI)](https://lti.cs.cmu.edu) at [Carnegie Mellon University (CMU](https://www.cmu.edu) in the [Master of Science in Intelligent Information Systems (MIIS)](https://miis.cs.cmu.edu) program. I work with Prof. [Xiong Chenyan](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cx/) on Efficient Dense Retrieval.  

Prior to undertaking my graduate degree, I worked at [DSO National Laboratories (DSO)](https://www.dso.org.sg) as a NLP Research Engineer, on projects related to cognitive AI and NLP on social media texts. For more information, refer to my CV [here](https://luoqichan.github.io/cv/). 


### /origin story
My NLP origin story started in Year 1 of my undergraduate degree when I participated in a research project  -- having barely learnt coding at that point in time, I was quickly fascinated by the way natural language was represented numerically. Although that project was merely a simple (but novel) text classification task, I was immediately interested to learn more. I went on to do an internship at DSO at the end of my first year, where I discovered that research is something I am excited about.  


### /me
Outside of research, you can typically find me cozied up with a cup of coffee (milk and two sugars, please), a Youtube video, and my latest knitting project.
